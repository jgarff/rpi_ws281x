# Example of low-level Python wrapper for rpi_ws281x library.
# Author: Tony DiCola (tony@tonydicola.com), Jeremy Garff (jer@jers.net)
#
# This is an example of how to use the SWIG-generated _rpi_ws281x module.
# You probably don't want to use this unless you are building your own library,
# because the SWIG generated module is clunky and verbose.  Instead look at the
# high level Python port of Adafruit's NeoPixel Arduino library in strandtest.py.
#
# This code will animate a number of WS281x LEDs displaying rainbow colors.
